The GAL algorithmic language is a marker-based language. All programs are compiled and run using the GAL. GAL markers can be translated into any natural language.
The language was defined with the main objective of teaching programming using algorithms. The algorithms are written with words from the students' native language that are translated and executed in GAL.
